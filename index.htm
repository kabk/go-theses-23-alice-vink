				<p>
					Ellen Ripley gazes at a grass field with trees while being seated on a bench surrounded by smaller plants. 
					She wishes she could feel the soft blades of grass and touch the rough bark of the trees.<br>
					However, as the camera zooms out, it reveals the harsh reality. The idyllic landscape is just a screen. 
					Ellen uses a small remote hidden in her hand to turn it off and looks down at the floor. The plants around her are all fake, 
					and the bench isn’t located in a field but a room that resembles a waiting area.<br> 
					Ellen looks worried, we later find out that she was waiting for news about her daughter whom she hasn’t heard from for so long. 
					The green scenery in this scene of the film <span class="link" onmouseenter="displayImg('content/ezgif-2-07430d05cb.gif', this); " onmouseout="removeImg();">
					Aliens (1986)</span> is a simulation of a current (and idealised) world in a faraway future, 
					where humans likely no longer have access to nature in this form.[1]<br>
				
					Nature then becomes a replica, produced on a screen, a hyper 
					digital and hyperreal image. A simulacra. Many other sci-fi movies set in future, located in outer space utilize similar green
					imagery to evoke a sense of nostalgia.<br><br>

					My fascination lies in the way the relationship between humans and nature is depicted in movies, and what it tells us about our real,
					actual, and current relationship with nature. I often feel that as humans we have lost touch with nature and that alienation is taking place, 
					which is one of the many reasons for issues like biodiversity loss, pollution, and exhaustion of the soil. 
					I want to understand better why this has happened. I aim to explore this topic, through an examination of contemporary popular (and less popular) movies.
					I’m using the tree as a ‘metaphor’ for nature in the wider sense. Why movies? Because movies mirror society’s ideas, norms, and values, and express 
					them in a visual and narrative form. <br><br> 
					
					Nature is an abstract concept that is difficult to define, with its meaning changing throughout history. In ancient Greece the word is based
					upon the verbal root of “growing, producing” and in ancient Rome, it held a primitive meaning of “birth, initial character” post-romantic
					philosophers like Rousseau and Marx defined it as “The whole of the material reality, considered as independent of human activity”.  
					In this context the concept of nature refers to the natural world, as it exists without human intervention or influence. 
					It is a view of nature that sees it as a collection of physical things, such as plants, animals, rocks, and water that are separate 
					from human society and culture. However, this definition creates a false separation between humans and nature.<br><br> <br> 
					
					I concur with the concept of nature as physical things being born, but my entire thesis discusses the symbolism and control of the natural world. 
					And since I am looking at contemporary movies, which are part of culture I must search for a better fitting concept that includes cultural and 
					controlled nature. <br> So, what is culture? culture is the arts, the ideas the intellectual expression of a society. 
					Its purpose is to interpret and give meaning to the world around us, what we call reality.
					Contemporary movies are part of post-modern culture. Which means that according to Baudrillard, 
					they are referencing other pieces of culture, because we are so bombarded with images, that that became our new reality. 
					Culture is no longer related to reality (as it did in pre-modern era with high art) but it is making simulations of simulations,
					what Baudrillard calls a simulacrum. We are now entering a time where we are unable to distinguish what is real and what is simulated, hyperreality. <br>  
					
					So, what we think about is nature, is a simulation, or hyperreality, of “The whole of the material reality, considered as independent of human activity”.
					Koert van Mensvoort, a Dutch philosopher, acknowledge this, we see nature as a beautiful phenomenon, that we admire from our screen, 
					and use as a marketing tool to sell products.  He thinks we must reevaluate nature, because we are born in a designed (simulated) world.<br> 
					We used to see everything born as nature, but our definition is shifting. We have a new nature caused and controlled by people. 
					He states that maybe everything (created or not created by us) beyond our control is our next nature. 
					Therefore, in this theory technological developments can also be considered as nature. Because we as humans are technological beings. <br> 
					
					Nature is an ever-evolving concept, that hold different meaning throughout history. 
					One of those meanings is: the physical world and living organisms that exist without human intervention. 
					The modern age blurs the lines between what is real and what is simulated, thanks to the significant force of
					culture shaping our understanding of nature. This has led to the emergence of “next-nature”, recognizing that human 
					have become technological being who design and control their environment, blurring the lines between what is considered natural and artificial. 
					Consequently, nature can be defined as the sum of all physical and technological phenomena that exist beyond human control,
					including the old definition of nature as everything born, as well as the new definition of nature caused by people. 
					For this thesis focusing on movies, which are part of post-modern culture, the simulacrum of our nature is being explored to 
					understand our relationship with it.<br> 
					
					I hope to find answers to one or more of the following questions:<br> 
					Can movies help me explain why our current way of ‘living’ with nature (or: relating to nature) is so unsustainable? <br> 
					Can we change this unsustainable relationship and make it ‘better’/more sustainable, or do we have to accept that 
					the Earth is changing (no more pristine nature, ancient forests, etc) and we need to find a new way to relate to it? <br><br> 
					 
					When thinking of a methodology: My thesis focus lies on the description of different cases deriving from film and popular culture. <br> 
					The movies mentioned are Aliens (James Cameron, 1986), Lord of the rings The Two Towers (J. R. R. Tolkien books, 1954, 
					and movie directed by Peter Jackson, 2002), My Princess Mononoke (Studio Ghibli, 1997), Prometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012),<br> 
					The Skin I Live In (Pedro Almodóvar, 2011), Dune (Book by Frank Herbert 1965, movie Dennis Villeneuve 2021),<br> 
					Blade Runner 2048 (Dennis Villeneuve, 2017), Annihilation (only book Jeff Vandermeer). <br><br>

					Treebeard’s friends were cut down by the Orcs, who are the army of an evil wizard. Their wood was being used for fire and weapons for

					In 2015, Suzanne Simard, launched a large-scale scientific experiment to demonstrate that trees in a way communicate with one another. 
					The giant mother trees, which are the tallest and receive the most sunlight, transfer sugar from their leaves to their roots via the process of

					These baby trees receive so little sunlight, that they can’t survive without the food supply of the mother trees.   
					“Forests aren’t a bunch of trees competing, they are co-operators. Mother trees are vital for knowledge passed around in certain species. ”
					Trees also communicate warnings of impending danger, such as insect attacks. This communication doesn’t just occur via the mycelium network,
					but also via a release of specific smells. For example, in the savannas in Africa, giraffes feed on Acacia trees. However, after a few minutes of 
					eating the tasty leaves, the trees begin to protect themselves by releasing toxins that make their leaves taste bitter, a flavour giraffes dislike. 
					The tree doesn’t only protect itself, but it also warns its neighbours by releasing a particular gas called ethylene, which the neighbouring trees can

					The Christian God has established a hierarchical structure that places humans above plants, considering humans to be more valuable. 
					This has potentially les to the development of an anthropocentric way of thinking, where humans are the centre of the universe. 
					However, there are many other ways of thinking like biocentrism, ecocentrism and transhumanism for example.  
					Additionally, other religions, like Buddhism have different structures that oppose a hierarchical one. 
					Animism is the belief that all living creatures have a soul, everything in nature possesses some kind of spiritual essence. 
					A movie that tries to illustrate this is in a very beautiful way is the Japanese anime Princess Mononoke . 
					In the movie trees, forest and animal spirits take physical forms, becoming creatures with emotions and human voices. 
					These creatures are angry because humans are attacking the forest, they are exploiting the forest and killing the animals living in it. 
					The equality the organisms is portrayed through their emotions and desires. Not only humans want and feel things, but all the living 
					creatures are full of emotions and desires. 
					While the spirits of the animals, and the humans are fighting and relentlessly killing each other, the forest spirit in Princess Mononoke 
					remains calm. It holds the knowledge and power over the forest, and had the ability to decide what will live and what will die. 
					In a forest life and death are in a way intertwined, what dies becomes something else. The forest spirit recognizes that the forest 
					is a collective being and the scars caused by the humans eventually heal. However the spirit’s calmness disappears when one of the humans 
					chops off its head and steals it. The forest spirit cannot continue (too an afterlife?) without his head and releases a deathly black gulp
					that devours the whole environment. The spirit rests only when its head is returned, emphasizing the importance of protecting the knowledge
					and intelligence of the forest to ensure it’s survival. <br> When the head is returned baby trees start to grow from the black gulp the spirit released. 
					In both Princess Mononoke and The Lord of the Rings (where the Ent and tree friends are also victimized), trees are portrayed as human-like creatures
					that might have been created to provoke empathy in the audience. 
					<br><br>
					We need to protect ourselves against ourselves.

			<p>
					It’s Christmas 2089 and Janek has just awoken from his hypersleep of two long years. He is now 35 light-years away from planet Earth. 
					With plenty of experience in hypersleep, Janek quickly shakes off the bodily distress that comes with it and climbs out of his pod. 
					He lights up a cigarette and thinks, “Did I really sign up for this mission?” It all sounds like a tale to him. 
					Along with him were 19 other men and an android, all headed to a planet on which, according to a scientist couple, the creators of humanity might live… 
					Janek shrugs his doubts off thinking to himself “Well. Whatever. At least it pays some good dough.” And with that, he makes his way to the dining room.
					Before he starts eating breakfast he takes a box out of his luggage, which contains a plastic Christmas tree. 
					He starts setting up the tree whilst around him people eat and chat. Janek finds joy in this little task. 
					Suddenly, a stiff and strict-looking woman walks toward him, she seems confused.
				    “What the hell is that?” she asks, Janek takes the cigarette out of his mouth and replies, “It’s Christmas, we need holidays to show time is still moving.” 
					She doesn’t seem amused by his comment and tells him to get ready for the mission briefing which is about to start. 
					Later, we find out that this mission will reveal all the secrets of humanity’s creation. 
					It’s Christmas 2022 in Rotterdam, I look outside the window onto the street, and I see a big, decorated Christmas tree in front of 
					the church that’s opposite my parents’ house. Just like Janek’s Christmas tree, it reminds me of the passing of time and the arrival of winter. 
					“Prometheus” is a sci-fi movie about faith, in which humans look for their creators. 
					The scene’s use of a plastic Christmas tree is quite revealing of possible futuristic scenarios.
					Hinting at an underlying desire to preserve a tree-like image even in a complete artificial environment.
					 It also highlights that this tradition is not centred on the tree but rather the symbolism it presents. 
					 This becomes apparent in the aftermath of Christmas when we witness heaps of discarded trees littering the streets. 
					 We only care about the tree during the period in which it holds meaning for us.
					Where does this tradition come from? We think that the early Romans, Vikings, and other ancient civilisations, 
					decorated their homes with boughs of evergreen trees, which retain their green leaves throughout all seasons. 
					They celebrated the solstice, the shortest day of the year, because it marked the day the sun was coming back, 
					and all the green plants would soon grow again.  The evergreens became a symbol of life over death, fertility, and victory. 
					The Christmas tree is not the only evergreen symbol we put up in our homes during Christmas. 
					The mistletoe is another one. Kissing underneath a mistletoe is a tradition that most likely stems from the Celtic Druids. 
					Because of their ability to blossom all year round, mistletoe became a symbol of fertility . 
					The mistletoe is a parasite that needs a host tree to survive. If there are too many mistletoes on a tree, the tree might not survive. 
					For us it’s a symbol of life, for the tree it’s a possible sign of death. 
					Trees appear green due to the process of photosynthesis which involves the pigment chlorophyll. 
					Chlorophyll is responsible for the green colour of plants, in our eyes. Photosynthesis is a biological process that produces oxygen, 
					making green truly the colour of life. Therefore, admiring the green colour of plants for its life-giving properties sounds very logical.
					About 2500 years ago the Greeks identified air, much later in 1774 Joseph Priestly identified oxygen, recognizing that air is a consumed. 
					It’s an interesting note that humans chose trees, especially evergreens, as symbol of life, even though they didn’t know that trees literally provide life.
					Conversely, green is also the most toxic colour. The pigment Emerald Green was introduced by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1775 , 
					which contains the highly poisonous copper arsenide and cause various illnesses. Green is thus the colour of both life and death. 
					But green trees will not remain green forever and will eventually die. 
					Expect for Janek’s Christmas tree, this small plastic tree who travelled for many years in a box in the packing area of a spaceship is 
					something I would like to call a “Forever-green”.

<div class="Dune">
	<a id="chapter-4"><h1 id="Chapter3">When green trees turn brown</h1></a>
			<h3>
				<p>
					The unforgiving planet of Arrakis, more commonly known as Dune, was a place where temperatures could rise to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, 
					making it impossible for any human to survive without adequate protection. Devoid of any appearance of plant life, Dune holds only a single, prized resource: Spice. 
					This psychoactive drug holds the power to prolong life and supports space travel. 
					Paul, the young duke of the ruling family Atreides, has just arrived on Dune, tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the spice fields. 
					Born and raised on the lush paradise planet of Caladan, Paul was a stranger to the unforgiving landscape of Dune, where even the sight of a single plant was a rarity. 
					It was on a stroll through the gardens of his residence that Paul first noticed the date palms.
					“I didn’t know date palms can be found out here.” Paul says to the man. 
					“Oh… These aren’t indigenous. They can’t survive without me…” he continues.
 					“Each one of these drinks every day the equivalent of five man… Twenty palm trees… 
					A hundred lives…” 
					Paul frowns. “Should we remove them? Save the water.”
					“No, no, no!” The man says immediately “These are sacred.” 
					He touches the bark of the palm and looks at Paul “Old dream.”  
					In the movie, the dream is not further elaborated. The most logical connection to what this dream might be is probably the dream of more water, 
					which could Dune more bearable. In the book Dune  (SPOILER ALERT) the local population (the Fremen) believes in a lost paradise, referring to the belief 
					that Dune once was a fertile and lush world. This is the reason why, unlike in the movie, the Fremen despised the palm trees, which waste precious water resources. 
					Without the Fremen’s knowledge, higher powers intentionally keep water resources to maintain control and power over them. 
					This power game results in a literal loss of paradise, where no plants and trees can grow, and humans must drink their own sweat to stay alive. 
					Intentionally altering a planet to make it more hospitable for human life (or in the case of Dune, less hospitable) is called “terraforming”. 
					The loss of Dune’s paradise can be seen as a cautionary tale of the potential consequences of human intervention in the natural world.
					Dates are highly nutritious, making them a blessing in the harsh environment of the desert. 
					The date palm tree has been referenced in ancient civilisations and mentioned in various religions. As date palm are part of the Evergreen family, 
					they hold the same type of symbolic value as other Evergreen species, symbolizing life over death, and victory because of its leaves staying green. 
					Therefore, using dry brown-looking date palms in Dune might symbolize false hope, a fading of green, the old dream. 
					Dates are celebrated in all the Abrahamic religions; with slight differences in symbolism, it holds both in the Islamic faith as in 
					Judaism meanings of prosperity, fertility and in both religions, it has a feminine association with the tree.  
					The date palm is not the only tree mentioned in the Abrahamic religions. Throughout history, trees have been closely linked to paradise. 
					In the Abrahamic religions, the Garden of Eden and its trees symbolize an ideal place where everything was once perfect, without sorrow. 
					Although, the meaning of the garden of Eden varies between the religions, it can be seen as the idyllic state of humanity before the introduction of suffering. 
					In Dune however, the dried out brown date palms, signify the suffering endured by the local population, indicating the loss of paradise. 
					This made me think of a TV show I watched called “Sinan op zoek naar het paradijs”   (Sinan searching for paradise). 
					His journey takes him to Qurna, a city in Iraq, where the mighty river Tigris and Euphrates converge. 
					Here he discovers a shrine dedicated to a dead tree. The people of Qurna belief that this is the garden of Eden, and the thousand-year-old dead tree is the tree of knowledge. 
					Although it is not officially recognised site by Islamic authority. As Sinan speaks to a botanist who has devoted his life to take care of the tree, 
					he learns that the tree was dug out during war and planted somewhere safely. After the conflicts it was planted back in the garden. 
					Despites being dried out and lifeless, the tree remains a symbol of paradise for the people of Qurna, perhaps a symbol of peace and calmed. 
					There is a contradiction between these dead trees that are being kept alive, by the population and the respect we have for Treebeards friends and the Christmas trees. 
					Could it be that the introduction of suffering makes the trees more valuable symbol of paradise? Is brown a more powerful symbolic colour than green? 
					Life is more celebrated when death comes closer.

		K is a Nexus-9 Replicant  and a Blade Runner on the biggest mission of his life. A couple weeks ago, he found a box containing the remains of a female replicant who 
		had died after giving birth through a c-section. This discovery was impossible, as replicants were not supposed to biologically reproduce, and it could potentially ignite a 
		devastating war. Thus, K has been tasked with finding and disabling the human-humanoid child that might exist. Desperately searching for any clues, 
		K comes across a scientist who creates memories for replicants. 
		K walks into the dream of a forest.
		In 2049, humans had created bioengineered humanoids known as replicants, who possessed superhuman capabilities and designed for jobs we could not or did not want to do. 
		However, since humans didn’t give the replicants memories they underdeveloped empathy, what made them dangerous. As such the old replicant species must be wiped out, 
		a task carried out by a specialized police force known as Blade Runners. 
		To avoid these problems, humans began creating replicants with human memories. One such memory is of a beautiful green forest, even though the world outside is a desert,
		dry land, or an industrial city. The dream of a particular type of green flourishing nature was created, a simulacrum, as humans don’t want the replicants to grow up with a “ruined” nature. 
		We give the replicants these dreams and memories, to make them feel more human. In other words, according to this movie a beautiful green forest is an essential part of humanity. 
		According to Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, trees are one of the archetypes, which are universal symbols, or patterns, that exist in the collective unconscious of the human mind.
		Carl Jung explored the recurring image of trees in dreams, drawings, fantasies, and the symbolism it held and saw connections in the meaning given to trees, by people of every type of culture. 
		People who had not any prior knowledge to the symbolism of the tree, gave it the same symbolic values as growth, connection, stability, and nourishment.  
		In the context of Blade Runner 2049, K. and other humanoids are exposed to a constructed reality, a simulacrum, just as in Aliens, of a peaceful, lush, and vivid forest. 
		Instead of a dark, dangerous, uncanny forest. Humans are playing with the archetypes.9
		In the book Annihilation a lighthouse is the epicentre of an “unnatural” force who is slowly expanding. Inside, nature is deforming, annihilated and slowly becomes human. 
		Dolphins with human eyes, plants with human cells and fungi growing in the shape of human words. Humans themselves become something beyond human. 
		The alien living in this area, mirrors humans and creates duplicates of the humans it encounters, destroying their original form beyond death. 
		But in this scenario to estranged for the human fantasy. 
		Annihilation feels like a metaphor for how the natural world is becoming more and more human, whilst humans themselves are becoming more and more estranged from the natural world and humanity. 
 		“Does it matter for the physical and psychological well-being of the human species that actual nature is being replaced with technological nature?
		As the basis for our provisional answer (it is ‘‘yes’’) … The concern is that, by adapting gradually to the loss of actual nature and to the increase of 
		technological nature, humans will lower the baseline across generations for what counts as a full measure of the human experience and of human flourishing.”

			“Two world trends are powerfully reshaping human existence, the degradation of large parts of the natural world, un unprecedented technological developments.”<br>
			<br><br>
			“Many of these trees were my friends.” discusses deforestation and the destruction of social networks of trees and ecosystems.<br> 
			The movies I have chosen to show a sense of awareness of our actions, as humanoid forest creatures like Ents and animal spirits fight against the exploiters and destroyers of the forests. 
			These movies serve as a warning for us to protect ourselves against ourselves. They play with a type of anticipatory nostalgia, mourning the loss of the future.
			Deforestation is not a new phenomenon; humans have been manipulating and cultivating the natural world for a very long time. <br>
			Christianity and other religions have further justified this relationship, positioning humans above other beings in nature. <br>
			Over time, the imagery of green trees and lush forests has become a symbol of humanity’s power and intelligence in shaping it’s environment, and making life more comfortable.<br>
			In the“Forever-Greens”. I explore the symbolism of green trees in human culture, such as the use of evergreen trees during Christmas as a symbol of life, victory, and fertility. <br>
			However, as seen in the movie Prometheus, a plastic Christmas tree represents time instead of being valued as living organism,
			highlighting a shift towards valuing the symbolism of the tree over the tree itself as a living entity.
			But green trees die, in “When green trees become brown” I discuss the value of date palms in the movie Dune, 
			where they are worth more than human life due to their representation of paradise on a desert planet.
			This contrasts with Treebeard’s friends, and even Christmas trees, where deforestation leads to the destruction of ecosystems. 
			In Dune and Abrahamic religions, trees become symbols of life and death, and the loss of paradise reflected in the portrayal of brown, dying trees. In the science fiction movies, 
			I’ve selected for this thesis we often see humans struggling to survive on planets that have harsh living conditions. 
			The placements of trees in those movies are a smart symbolism towards the comfortable life that trees give us. Though, it is not often about the trees themselves, but more about the symbolism.
			This might be a reason of why our modern culture uses a particular type of imagery that has become a reality of its own, a beautiful phenomenon. A hyperreality.
			But what do people do to create this hyperreality? 
			“A world full of topiaries” explores humans’ obsessive behaviour towards their surroundings. 
			In “The Skin I Live In,” the surgeon’s use of a human guinea pig for the experimentation is metaphorically represented by the manipulation and control of a Bonsai tree. 
			Trees in cities and forests are also subject to human control, creating “A world full of topiaries.”
			Where trees in cities have become a decorative element that blends in as white noise. 
			Similarly, in games, trees are used as a resemblance of the real world and have often no purpose other than decoration.
			In “Annihilation” I delve into the idea of whether digital representations of nature help us connect to our humanity, according to blade runner 2049, 
			with non-human humanoids fed memories of idyllic forests as a way of playing with the archetypes. 
			Throughout history, humanity has strived to make life more comfortable. This had led to countless technological advancements and modifications. 
			The imagery of a natural world with lush trees and forests, has become a symbol of comfortability and humanity’s power and intelligence in controlling and shaping of its environment.
			In modern times, this image resembles more a hyperreality, whre 
			As we continue our journey onwards, we must remember the importance of the natural world, and our connection to it.
			The trees, the forests, and all of nature must be appreciated for their inherent worth, not just for the comfort they provide us. 
			Only then we might find our way back to paradise.
